          Over the course of my Muay Thai journey, I have gained invaluable experience and knowledge, both through practice and serving as a student and teacher. This martial art, often referred to as the "Art of Eight Limbs," has taught me important life skills and lessons that have shaped my personal growth.

          First and foremost, I have developed a strong sense of discipline and dedication. Consistent practice and training in Muay Thai required me to commit to a rigorous routine, pushing through physical and mental barriers. This discipline has translated into other aspects of my life, improving my focus and work ethic.

And we think I struggled with this question because as a Canadian citizen and living here for the majority of my life, I viewed outside cultures as strange due to my ignorance, I valued my beliefs and held true to my values. However, with the exploration of discovery similar to most of our ancestors to survive terrible acts of takeovers, I've grown to understand how big the world is, and how close we're all related tools we create to protect your Saturday close ourselves and Bing keeps people who view as outsiders out. We are all human. And with the help of utilizing a digital media storytelling format, I'll hopefully convince what I believe makes us human and makes us different, and bring you closer to your neighbors outside of our walls.

We are responsible for our fellow Global Citizen and our shared will. among the several challenges of being a global citizen are the last traditions of policies or economic entanglements with other countries creating separation, the lack of global citizenship education shelters to the students from thinking for themselves, and in turn thinking only as a society created challenges to break the walls between country to country. Let me once idea to define what it means to be a human. The challenge I hope to address is what it means to be a human in the world that we collectively share divided by walls.
